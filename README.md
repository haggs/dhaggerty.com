# dhaggerty.com

This is the source code for my personal website [dhaggerty.com](https://dhaggerty.com). Originally I had built this whole thing in Gatsby, with markdown files for each job, a collection of personal photo albums, hosted on Netlify, blah blah blah. Now it's a no frills, vanilla JS site.

I realize the irony of using *no* React/Typescript in a website for a React/Typescript developer. However, I think it's better to showcase that I choose the simplest tool for the job, and let my resume speak for my React skills.

## Note to myself, when I come back to this code years later

This is hosted on GitHub pages. You can run `bun dev` for a dev server.
